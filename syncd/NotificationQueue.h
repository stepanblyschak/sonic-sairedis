/**
 * @brief Default notification queue size limit.
 *
 * Value based on typical L2 deployment with 256k MAC entries and
 * some extra buffer for other events like port-state, q-deadlock etc
 *
 * Note: We recently found a case where SAI continuously sending switch notification events
 *       that also caused the queue to keep growing and eventually exhaust all system memory and crashed.
 *       So a new detection/limit scheme is being implemented by keeping track of the last Event
 *       and if the current Event matches the last Event, then the last Event Count will get
 *       incremented and this count will also be used as part of the equation to ensure this
 *       notification should also be dropped if the queue size limit has already reached and not
 *       just dropping FDB events only.
 * TODO: move to config, also this limit only applies to fdb notifications
